# Akypuera 
#

Akypuera is a tracing library for MPI applications released under GPLv3.
The library, simplified as aky (linked with -laky to mpi apps), uses 
libRastro to provide a low memory footprint and low intrusion. The binary
trace files are converted to paje file format using the tool called
aky_converter. Akypuera is a word from the tupi language that means trace.
